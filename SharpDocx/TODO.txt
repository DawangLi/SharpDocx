-Fix bug in Inheritance sample.

Consider:
-Use a proper C# parser, so there are no potential issues with e.g. brackets in strings/comments/etc.
-Support code blocks in DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Vml.TextPath.String.
-Insert merge fields.
-Multiple calls to write in the same code block should result in concatenated text.
-Implement ViewBag.
-Support C# 6.

Won't fix:
-Support contructed generic types as Model in .NET v3.5.
