-Multiple calls to write in the same code block should be handled correctly.
-Mention Model and Inhertitance in Tutorial.
-Insert merge fields.

Consider:
-Show inheritance model in Tutorial (e.g. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178138.aspx).
-Use a proper C# parser, so there are no potential issues with e.g. brackets in strings/comments/etc.
-Support code blocks in DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Vml.TextPath.String.
-Implement ViewBag.
-Support C# 6.
-Create sample with a complex form.

Won't fix:
-Support contructed generic types as Model in .NET v3.5.
