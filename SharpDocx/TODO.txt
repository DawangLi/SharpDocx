-Inheritance: insert hyperlink.
-Code in headers/footers
-Insert merge fields.
-Map.Replace should update Text, Map and Elements OR shouldn't be a method of Map.

Consider:
-Show inheritance model in Tutorial (see also https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178138.aspx)
-ElementAppender supports only one template row/paragraph in a code block at a time. Maybe support multiple templates per code block?
-Implement ViewBag
-Use a proper C# parser, so there are no issues with e.g. brackets in strings/comments/etc.
-Use XML documentation comments.
-Support C# 6
-Create sample with barcode
-Create models/samples with https://www.theimdbapi.org/

Won't fix:
-Support contructed generic types as Model in .NET v3.5.
