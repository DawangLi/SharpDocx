-Insert merge fields.
-Introduce a dirty flag for the map.

Consider:
-Show inheritance model in Tutorial (see also https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178138.aspx).
-ElementAppender supports only one template row/paragraph in a code block at a time. Maybe support multiple templates per code block.
-Implement ViewBag.
-Use a proper C# parser, so there are no issues with e.g. brackets in strings/comments/etc.
-Support code blocks in for DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Vml.TextPath.String.
-Use XML documentation comments.
-Support C# 6.
-Create samples with a nice form / barcode / nice model (maybe a model based on https://www.theimdbapi.org/).

Won't fix:
-Support contructed generic types as Model in .NET v3.5.
